Code to look at PL maps at different wavelengths.

`PLplotter_single_wav.py` - code used to look at PL maps at single wavelength.

How to use the code:
1. Run the code and wait for plot window to open.
2. PL map is displayed on the right-hand side of the screen and the spectrum is on the left-hand side (spectrum is empty by default).
3. Click anywhere on the PL map and the red marker will highlight the position of the point just clicked and the spectrum of that point will be shown in the other subplot.
4. Click on the spectrum to change the wavelength of PL map displayed on the right-hand side of the window.

`test2.sdm` was used for plotting data.

`pl-analyser-environment.yml` - conda environment file.
